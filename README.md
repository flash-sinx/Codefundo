  The idea is to create a website which will work like a forum where girls can post their problems anonymously . The problems will be majorly regarding boys not treating them well or anything like that. They will have to make accounts on the website then after that website will contain groupwise post sections . Groups will be categorised based on their colleges or communities . So, basically girls will post their problems any boy/man is posing to them and what kind of problem is it  and who is posing it so that either they  can discuss a common solution for their problem or for colleges they will know what kind of boy is who like who is using the girls problems like that.
